# **Background**
This paper is a comprehensive effort to integrate features from different disciplines to better
understand, characterize, and predict chronic pain conditions.

Study highlights:

- We developed a psychosocial model using data from the UK Biobank (n= ~ 500k) capable of
predicting and characterizing the longitudinal development of chronic pain in healthy individuals
and its spreading or recovery in patients.
- The psychosocial model was found to be more closely linked to
biological components (functional neuroimaging, genetic and 
inflammatory risk factors) than pain itself, suggesting that biological factors are more strongly
expressed in the psychosocial condition predisposing pain than in the subsequent pain outcomes.
- We show that a variety of chronic pain conditions can be studied from
a common psychosocial risk, providing support for the framework of a general chronic pain
syndrome.
- We found that the aggregated risk in the biopsychosocial framework may predispose
individuals to develop pain at multiple sites, with greater risk associated with a wider spreading
of pain across body sites.
